  - name: JAVA_INIT_MEM_RATIO
    description: This is used to calculate a default initial heap memory based the maximumal heap memory.  The default is `100` which means 100% of the maximal heap is used for the initial heap size.  You can skip this mechanism by setting this value to `0` in which case no `-Xms` option is added.
    value: 0
  - name: JAVA_MAX_MEM_RATIO
    description: This is used to calculate a default maximal heap memory based on a containers restriction. If used in a container without any memory constraints for the container then this option has no effect. If there is a memory constraint then `-Xmx` is set to a ratio of the container available memory as set here. The default is `50` which means 50% of the available memory is used as an upper boundary. You can skip this mechanism by setting this value to `0` in which case no `-Xmx` option is added.

    description: "A query used to discover cluster members via DNS. If a value is provided for this variable, then the
    JGroups discover protocol defined in the specified JGROUPS_TRANSPORT is overridden to use the JGroups.DNS_PING protocol
    with the value of this variable used as the 'dns_query' parameter."
