# Infinispan Server Image

This repository contains various artifacts to create Infinispan server images.

## Creating Images
### Prerequisites
All of our images are created using the [Cekit](https://cekit.io) tool. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.cekit.io/en/latest/handbook/installation/instructions.html).

> The exact [dependencies](https://docs.cekit.io/en/latest/handbook/installation/dependencies.html#) that you will require depends on the "builder" that you want to use in order to create your image. For example OSBS has different requirements to Docker.

### Infinispan
This is the default that will create an image using the upstream Infinispan server. To create this image as `infinispan/server` using the Docker builder, issue the following command:
```bash
cekit build docker
```

### Data Grid
In order to create an image using the Red Hat Data Grid server, it's necessary to have an active Red Hat kerberos session. The image can then be created using the following command:
```bash
cekit build --overrides-file dg-override.yaml docker
```
